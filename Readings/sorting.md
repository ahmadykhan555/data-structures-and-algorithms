# Sorting

Sorting is simply reordering the data in some shape according to some condition. We may a list to be sorted in ascending order/decending order or some custom order. This is a great problem to put one's algorithm design skills to the test. It is an interesting place to sharpen your problem solving skills as well. In this section we will take a look at how to construct a sorting algorithm and step by step optimize it for best performance.
