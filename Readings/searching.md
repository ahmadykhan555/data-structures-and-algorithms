# Searching Algorithms

In this chapter we take a look at how searching algorithms are defined and implemented. We will take a look at the naive brute-force approach first and progressively dive into the more efficient performant ways of searching.

#### Algorithms:

- Linear Search in an Array
- Binary Search in a sorted array
- String searching algorithm
- KMP string searching algorithm
