### Chapter One: Big O Notation

In computer science being able to write a solution for an interesting problem is one of the preliminary steps towards becoming an excellent computer scientist. The robustness of a solution that can handle and cover a vast range of cases is one feat of engineering but how do we measure if one solution is more performant as opposed to another solution. In computer science the efficiency of an algorithm is often analyzed in the amount of time & steps the algorithm takes to reach a certain result.

### Chapter Two: Problem Solving Techniques & Patterns

Diving into coding the moment we lay our eyes on a problem statement can be very tempting at times but one can run into a dead end if one dives in without giving a considerable thought to what he is looking to solve. This chapter touches upon this problem that many programmer often find themselves stumbling across. Following [Patterns](https://github.com/ahmadykhan555/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/Readings/problemSolving.md#problem-solving-patterns) are discussed in this chapter.

- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide & Conquer

### Chapter Three: Recursion

Recursion is an alternative of an iterative (looping) approach. This is a slightly confusing topic at first but once we get the hang of it, its really simple and efficient to use. Recursion is a pattern where a function calls itself (as opposed to some other function) until it gets to a solution.

### Chapter Four: Searching Algorithms

In this chapter we take a look at how searching algorithms are defined and implemented. We will take a look at the naive brute-force approach first and progressively dive into the more efficient performant ways of searching.
